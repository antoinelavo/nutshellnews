#### Initial Offer
In [2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/us/politics/trump-greenland.html), President Donald Trump expressed interest in purchasing Greenland from Denmark, suggesting it could be a strategic acquisition for the United States.  
<br/><br/>

#### Rejection by Denmark
Denmark quickly rejected the offer, emphasizing Greenland's autonomy and the nature of the relationship between Denmark and Greenland.  
<br/><br/>

#### Strategic Importance
Trump argued as recently as [January 2025](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/25/world/trump-greenland-purchase-analysis-intl/index.html) that Greenland's location could serve as a crucial military base for the U.S. in the Arctic region, particularly for countering Russia’s growing influence.  
<br/><br/>

#### Diplomatic Fallout
The proposal led to a diplomatic row between the U.S. and Denmark, with the Danish Prime Minister openly criticizing the idea, calling it absurd.  
<br/><br/>

#### Lasting Interest
Despite the rejection, Trump continued to show interest in Greenland, often referring to its resources and geopolitical value in his discussions about U.S. foreign policy.
